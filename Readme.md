# Cost optimisations of a waterless barrier to stop toads entering the Pilbara

This repo contains code used by Southwell *et al.* (2017, *J. Appl Ecol.* 54:216-224) to run cost optimisations around the idea of a waterless barrier to stop toads.

The code in /scripts is largely that produced by Darren Southwell (provided to Ben Phillips in 2019), which itself built off the earlier code from Tingley *et al.* (2013, *J. Appl Ecol.* 50:129-137), which was a joint coding project between Ben Phillips and Reid Tingley.  Neither of these earlier coding projects was under version control.

In 2019, Ben wanted to produce a Shiny web app showing the region and the waterpoints and allowing the viewer to get a rough idea of the (2016) cost associated with converting infrastructure in various places. To do this, Ben gathered the code from Darren, placed it under version control, re-ran a new batch of simulations, and built the web app (in /webApp directory).
